# 11/25 SLM Research Meeting


## Context
    Last week Dr. Ding and I worked on getting me in an indepedent study (CS 485) for the upcoming spring semester.
    His request from me was that I narrow down my research topic to a niche and a problem state, ideally somewhere that I know well and have an existing ideas.


## Main





### Questions
- Why does my idea work intuitively?



## Postmeeting
- Claude Opus 4.5 is focused on agentic use case. They use Tool search Tool.  How does my approach compare to Claude Opus 4.5 on benchmarks
